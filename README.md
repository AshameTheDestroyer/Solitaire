# Solitaire

I'm revisiting TypeScript with React-TS, and I found it pretty good actually, that I think Imma build all of my future projects with it 🔧.

### v1. First Commit
I made the playing cards with SCSS and SVGs, it was pretty fun TBH.

### v2. Card Deck
I'm experimenting with TypeScript and I made some logic to reorganize the Card Deck in 3 possible ways.

### v3. Gameboard Initializing
I've initialized the gameboard to make it playable later on, and furthermore, I tweaked the cards aspect a little bit for mobile devices.

### v4. Gameboard Designing
The full design of the gameboard is now complete, I may have to tweak things later on though.
