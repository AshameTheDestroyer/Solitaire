# Solitaire

I'm revisiting TypeScript with React-TS, and I found it pretty good actually, that I think Imma build all of my future projects with it ðŸ”§.

v1. I made the playing cards with SCSS and SVGs, it was pretty fun TBH.

v2. I'm experimenting with TypeScript and I made some logic to reorganize the Card Deck in 3 possible ways.
