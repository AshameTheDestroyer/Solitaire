# Solitaire

I'm revisiting TypeScript with React-TS, and I found it pretty good actually, that I think Imma build all of my future projects with it ðŸ”§.

### v1. First Commit
I made the playing cards with SCSS and SVGs, it was pretty fun TBH.

### v2. Card Deck
I'm experimenting with TypeScript and I made some logic to reorganize the Card Deck in 3 possible ways.

### v3. Gameboard Initializing
I've initialized the gameboard to make it playable later on, and furthermore, I tweaked the cards aspect a little bit for mobile devices.

### v4. Gameboard Designing
The full design of the gameboard is now complete, I may have to tweak things later on though.

### v5. Card Animations
Added few animations to the cards being placed down one by one, and the deck when cards being drawn from, and they look neat!

### v6. Actual Gameplay
Now the game's finally playable, hurray! and I'm sick of the project already.

### v7. Finalization
I added light/dark theming, page reloading reassurance whilst playing, and a sick pattern for the background.

### v8. Landing Page
Nothing's fancy, OK JK, maybe only the landing page that I added to the website, and fixed some minor issues too.

### v9. Command Manager
This might be the last version apparently, it's the best one so far tho.
I've added a Command Manager that allowes the player to UNDO and REDO commands they did in the game, such as moving or drawing cards, which is incredible in my honest opinionâ€¦ And as well as usual, I fixed some bugs that was literally bugging the hell outta me.
Now the game is at its best version so far ðŸ”¥.
